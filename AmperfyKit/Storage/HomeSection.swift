  case resume

  case recentlyAdded
  // cassette Patch 038: fourth shelf — artists ordered by recent
  // song play activity. Appended (ordinal 13) for Codable backwards-
  // compat; surfaced in defaultValue/editableSections between
  // resume and yourPlaylists.
  case recentlyPlayedArtists
  // cassette Patch 042: heterogeneous "Recent" shelf merging recently-
  // played albums, playlists, artists, and freshly-added albums into
  // one row sorted by interaction date. Appended (ordinal 14) so
  // legacy `accountSettings.homeSections` Codable payloads keep
  // decoding; .resume left in the enum but no longer rendered.
  case recent
  // cassette (Forgotten Albums): owned albums the user has drifted from — the
  // anti-recency shelf. Appended (ordinal 15) so legacy Codable `homeSections`
  // payloads keep decoding.
  case forgottenAlbums

  // cassette: the six Mood tiles (Get Pumped, Focus, ...) — a HEADER-ONLY
  // section (zero HomeItems; see HomeVC's supplementary-view handling for
  // .moodDoors). A mood door isn't a PlayableContainable — it's a static
  // preset that generates a mixtape on tap, not a real library entity — so
  // it deliberately does NOT flow through the HomeItem/diffable-snapshot
  // pipeline the way every other shelf does. Appended (ordinal 16) per this
  // enum's own append-only Codable-compat rule.
  case moodDoors

  // cassette 2026-10-20: two rows from the phone's own play log (AmperfyKit/Home/
  // ListeningShelves.swift). Appended (ordinals 17, 18) per the append-only rule.
  case onRepeat
  case aroundNow
  // cassette 2026-10-20: albums on the phone matching the mood of recent listening.
  // Ordinal 19. Takes the Albums row's place on Home when it has anything to show.
  case moreLikeLately
  // cassette 2026-10-21: records you heard a song or two of lately (mostly from the
  // made-for-you playlists), a nudge to go deeper. Ordinal 20. Took over the one idea in
  // Recent that no other row carried.
  case fromYourMixes
  // cassette 2026-10-26: Put something on (founder: "its own row under Resume"). REMOVED from
  // Home 2026-10-28 (One Home, founder). The case stays, unused, so saved `homeSections`
  // that name ordinal 21 still decode.
  case putSomethingOn
  // cassette 2026-10-28 (One Home): the reaching row, the one shelf the moment picked (Loud
  // ones, Deep dive, Nostalgia, ...). Deep dive draws its record as one big card. Ordinal 22.
  case reach
  // cassette 2026-10-28 (One Home): the way to every shelf made today, at the end of Home.
  // Header-only. Ordinal 23.
  case allShelves

  // cassette redesign (Surface 4): Resume leads the Home IA again - a
  // single full-width card sourced from the lastPlayedDate FRCs.
  //
  // cassette 2026-10-28 (One Home): the cloud makes Home (GET /api/sync/home) and the phone
  // and the car draw its rows in its order. This list is only the phone's stand-in, drawn
  // while no answer has ever been held, in the same line-up as far as the phone's own rows
  // go: Resume, On Repeat, around now, made for you, your playlists, Radio, one reaching row
  // (More Like Lately, else Albums: HomeManager clears Albums while More Like has rows),
  // From Your Mixes, Artists.
