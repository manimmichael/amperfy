//  AlbumRegrouper.swift
//  AmperfyKit
//
//  Cassette fork — Phase 1 (Gap 1): device album grouping.
//
//  Collapses the device's OWNED songs onto the catalog-blind album group keys
//  the cloud computes (buildAlbumGroupKey), so the phone's albums match the web
//  character-for-character. The regroup is the per-sync authority for album
//  identity: it find-or-creates an AlbumMO whose id == group_key, re-points each
//  owned Song onto it, folds the emptied legacy albums' annotations + art, and
//  deletes the emptied legacy albums.
//
//  Idempotent — safe to run on every sync; once every owned song already points
//  at its group-key album it makes no changes. It is catalog-blind — two disk
//  albums that resolve to one catalog album (e.g. a box set) keep their distinct
//  group keys and stay separate.
//
//  It also MATERIALIZES a missing catalog record: the transfer path records a
//  DeviceOwnership row + the file but never builds the SongMO the library renders
//  from (those otherwise come only from a separate, online-gated library sync). So
//  an owned track can sit on disk yet render nowhere. The pre-pass below creates a
//  SongMO (id == the owned Subsonic id, title + duration from the grouping entry)
//  for any owned track that lacks one, so "owned" always equals "visible". It
//  never touches a file or a DeviceOwnership row — the OWNED-track count stays
//  invariant; only the SongMO count grows to match it.
