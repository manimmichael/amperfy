//
//  IntentExecutor.swift
//  AmperfyKit
//
//  Cassette fork — Layer 3 Phase 3.1 (Transfer Mechanism).
//
//  Polls cassette.digital for actionable sync intents and drives them to
//  completion: marks syncing, checks the Cassette Player is reachable on the
//  LAN, resolves the album's track list server-side, and enqueues background
//  downloads (or removals). State transitions are reported back so the admin
//  test tool can observe progress.
//
//  Idempotent by design: re-running an intent skips already-owned tracks and
//  already-in-flight downloads, then completes once everything is present.
//  This makes crash/relaunch recovery and the 30s foreground poll safe.
//
//  Phase 3.1 handles `scope == "album"` only. Other scopes fail with
//  `unsupported_scope_in_phase_31`.

  /// materialize path — unlike album covers, which are now native getCoverArt only.
  ///
  /// Unlike covers (one hop: `song.album?.artwork`), the artist image must NOT
  /// depend on the inherited `album → artist → artwork` graph. Cassette
  /// downloads build no Core Data graph and `SsSongParserDelegate` never links
  /// `album → artist`, so `song.album?.artist` is almost always nil — the old
  /// implementation dead-ended at its nil guard even though the server sent a
  /// URL. We instead resolve the artist the on-device library UI actually
  /// renders: the Artists list / Artist detail are keyed on the song→artist
  /// relationship (`DeviceOwnershipManager.fetchOwnedArtistIds` collects
  /// `song.artist?.id`; the FRC predicate is `id IN <thatSet>`), i.e.
  /// `song.artist`, which `SsSongParserDelegate` DOES populate. We:
  ///   1. resolve the target `Artist` robustly (`song.album?.artist`, else
  ///      `song.artist`, else create/link one by the song's artist name),
  ///   2. ensure it has an `Artwork` (create + attach one when nil), and
  ///   3. write the bytes + flip it to `.CustomImage`, exactly as the cover path.
  /// We attach to `song.artist` (the proven UI source) and, when present and
  /// distinct, also to `song.album?.artist` so either display path renders.
  ///
  /// Takes the raw `imageUrl` + the owned tracks' `subsonicIds` so both the
  /// transfer path (a fresh intent) and the backfill path (already-synced
  /// albums) drive the identical end-state.
  ///
  /// Pass `force: true` to BYPASS the "already .CustomImage on disk" gate so a
  /// CHANGED artist image overwrites the old file (content reconciliation
  /// increment 2). The artist/artwork resolution + provisioning still runs; only
  /// the on-disk skip is suppressed. The default preserves the absence-only
  /// behavior of every existing caller.
  /// Give an artist the image the HUB holds — the same way an album gets its cover.
  ///
  /// remoteInfo becomes (artist's Subsonic id, type "artist"), so the un-gated
  /// getCoverArt path serves the artist folder's `artist.*` file straight off the
  /// user's own disk. The phone no longer downloads artist photos from the cloud:
  /// that was the last cloud→phone media path, and it is exactly why a wrong face
  /// could persist on the device no matter what the library actually held.
  ///
  /// Two local faults are repaired here, because neither is visible upstream:
  ///  • a SHARED artwork row (one Artwork attached to two artists) — how a featured
  ///    artist ends up wearing the album artist's face. Confidently wrong art is
  ///    worse than none, so a shared row is treated as poisoned and this artist is
  ///    given its own.
  ///  • an artwork still on an OLDER identity (a synthetic id, or bytes pulled from
  ///    the cloud) — re-pointed so it re-fetches from the hub. This is what migrates
  ///    a device that already cached the wrong photo.
