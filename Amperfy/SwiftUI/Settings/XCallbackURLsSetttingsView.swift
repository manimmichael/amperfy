// MARK: - AdvancedSettingsView

// cassette §A2/§G: the "Advanced" screen (file name kept as
// XCallbackURLsSetttingsView.swift to avoid .pbxproj churn — rename deferred).
// The old X-Callback-URL documentation was removed from the settings tree (it
// was developer/protocol chrome and leaked into the iPad/Mac sidebar via
// `NavigationTarget.allCases`). Advanced now collects rare/diagnostic items —
// starting with the Event Log, moved here from Support.
