// cassette §G/§E: this is the "Playback" screen (file name kept as
// PlayerSettingsView.swift to avoid .pbxproj churn — rename deferred). It hosts
// the Equalizer entry (tucked here rather than as a top-level peer) plus the few
// playback prefs a normal listener would plausibly change. ReplayGain, Manual
// Playback, and Song Playback Resume were culled (§B/§D).

  // (previously hidden) cacheTranscodingFormatPreference, which the download
  // URL builder already honors: raw = the full-resolution original file,
  // mp3 = a smaller transcoded copy. Written straight through to the persisted
  // store, so no new SettingsHost binding is required.
