//  Amperfy
//
//  Cassette fork (phone-taste): the one model behind the Settings root's YOUR MAC and
//  THIS PHONE groups, the Your Mac page and the This Phone page, so the three never
//  disagree and nothing is fetched twice.
//
//  What is on the phone comes from the ownership records (DeviceOwnershipManager), read
//  off the main thread. What the Mac has comes from the cloud's live device endpoints
//  (CassetteSyncAPI.getMacSummary / getThisDeviceSummary), fetched once per page open,
//  never from the sync poll. The model listens for library and sync changes only while one
//  of its pages is on screen. The server's album keys never equal a phone album id, so every
//  server row goes through `resolveLocalAlbum` before it can show a local cover or play.
