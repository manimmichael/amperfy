//
//  ShareSongSheet.swift
//  Amperfy
//
//  Cassette: send a song (CASSETTE_SHARING.md). Share opens Apple's share sheet at once with the song's
//  link, and the friend's page says who it's from. A note is one row inside that sheet, Add a Note, so a
//  raw share stays one tap and a note, any length, is there for whoever wants one: the note sheet, then
//  Apple's share sheet again with the same link, now carrying the note.
//
//  The link's code is made here, so the sheet opens without a round trip. The share is saved in the
//  cloud as the sheet opens (POST /api/share/song), and the link only goes to the app the person picks
//  once it is saved (ShareSongLink), because WhatsApp and the rest fetch a preview the moment it lands.
//  Whether a song can be shared at all (one of its videos still plays) is asked before Share is offered
//  (ShareSongAvailability): a song with no video shows Share greyed out instead of failing afterwards.
//
//  Apple's parts throughout: UIActivityViewController with LPLinkMetadata built from the album cover, a
//  UIActivity for Add a Note, and for the note a page sheet with a vertical TextField, a segmented
//  Picker for the start moment and a prominent Button.
//
//  A note being written survives the note sheet being swiped away (ShareSongDrafts) until it is sent.
